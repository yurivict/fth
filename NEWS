* 1.3.8

Add config and build tool scripts for scons.  It's a replacement
for autoconfig tools.

Remove command line option -h.

New experimental targets in src/Makefile:
	fth-llvm and fth-llvm.sh
This requires C compiler clang as well as lli and llc from the llvm
project.  These targets are not required for a working fth interpreter.

New global function fth_xt_call and fth_xt_apply added.

New global function fth_regexp_var_ref added.

Global variable *clm-output-device* removed from
examples/site-lib/clm.fs.
