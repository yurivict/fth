* 1.3.7

Some Tcsh-like global Fth variables added to utils.c to control
libtecla's history mechanism and prompt style:

*histdup*	constant (undef|gl-all|gl-prev|gl-erase)
	gl-all	only unique history events are entered
	gl-prev	if the last history event is the same as the current
		command, the current command is not entered
	gl-erase if the same event is found in the history list, that old
		event gets erased and the current one gets inserted
	undef	all history events are entered (default)
*histfile*	string	~/.fth-history
*history*	number	100
*savehist*	boolean	#t
*promptstyle*	boolean #f
