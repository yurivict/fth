!-123			repeat 123rd last event
!!			repeat last event (same as !-1)
!?sub_string(?)		repeat last event containing SUB_STRING
!start_of_string	repeat last event starting with START_OF_STRING

If command line starts with ^, try a search from previous history events
and replace it with second part of ^search^replace.

^search^replace(^)

Some Tcsh-like global Fth variables added to src/utils.c to control
libtecla's history mechanism and prompt style:

	gl-all	only unique history events are entered
	gl-prev	if the last history event is the same as the current
		command, the current command is not entered
	gl-erase if the same event is found in the history list, that old
		event gets erased and the current one gets inserted
	undef	all history events are entered (default)
*histfile*	string	~/.fth-history
*history*	number	100
*savehist*	boolean	#t
*promptstyle*	boolean #f
