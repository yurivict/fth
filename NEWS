* 1.3.7

Some Tcsh-like global Fth variables added to utils.c to control
libtecla's history mechanism and prompt style:

*histdup*	constant (undef|gl-all|gl-prev|gl-erase)
	gl-all	only unique history events are entered
	gl-prev	if the last history event is the same as the current
		command, the current command is not entered
	gl-erase if the same event is found in the history list, that old
		event gets erased and the current one gets inserted
	undef	all history events are entered (default)
*histfile*	string	~/.fth-history
*history*	number	100
*savehist*	boolean	#t
*promptstyle*	boolean #f

New words in utils.c:
history
bindkey

stringizing macro FTH_XString() added to utils.h

Simple history expansion and substitution added to libtecla's input
functions.

If the command line starts with !, try to substitute with commands from
previous history events.

	!123			repeat event 123
	!-123			repeat 123rd last event
	!!			repeat last event (same as !-1)
	!?sub_string(?)		repeat last event containing SUB_STRING
	!start_of_string	repeat last event starting with START_OF_STRING

If the command line starts with ^, try a search from previous history
events and replace it with second part of ^search^replace.

	^search^replace(^)
