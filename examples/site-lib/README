You can place your own scripts here.  You may install them with:

	fth -ve "install your-script.fs"

This command installs *.fs scripts in ${prefix}/share/fth/site-fth.
`make install' creates an empty directory with that name.  This path
is already included in fth's search path.

The current *.fs files here are scripts for Bill Schottstaedt's sound
editor Snd.
