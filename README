NAME
     README -- installation information for the Fth package

INTRODUCTION
     Fth is a software package which includes the interpreter fth and the
     extension library libfth.	You can write Forth scripts and interpret them
     by the interpreter fth or you can link libfth into an application to use
     it as extension language.

     Fth's core language is Ficl, a Forth dialect written by John Sadler.  The
     Ficl source is included in the Fth source tree and is slightly changed to
     fit with Fth.  Ficl is more or less ANS compatible.  The Fth library
     contains object type extensions like arrays, hashs, strings, regexp etc.
     A GC tries to handle memory management of object types.  Fth is known to
     build with clang(1) as well as with gcc(1).

WHERE IS FTH LOCATED?
     You can get the latest archive from http://www.sf.net/projects/fth/.  If
     you prefer svn, you can get the source code from
     svn.code.sf.net/p/fth/code/.  Check out the source tree with
     % svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/fth/code/trunk fth
     and update it later with
     % svn update
     in the new fth directory.

REQUIREMENTS
     The interactive Fth interpreter supports tcsh-like command-line editing
     with the tecla(7) library.	 You can find a copy at
     http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mcs/tecla/libtecla-1.6.3.tar.gz.  If you
     won't use tecla(7), you can configure Fth without it, see CONFIGURE FTH.

     Bignumbers are supported by bn(3) from openssl.

   64-Bit-NetBSD and Tecla
     The libtecla package on NetBSD provides a static library libtecla.a.  On
     64-bit machines this package should be compiled with:
	   cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/libtecla
	   env CFLAGS=-fPIC make install clean

CONFIGURE FTH
     There are a few additional configure options which may be of interest.
     --disable-shared
	  Disable shared library support.
     --enable-warnings
	  Enable C compiler warning flags.
     --enable-maintainer-mode
	  `make maintainer-clean' removes files which need special developer
	  utilities.  Use this option with caution.
     --program-prefix
     --program-suffix
     --program-transform-name
	  More than one version of fth may be installed at the same time.  You
	  can manipulate the name to achieve this, for example:
		% ./configure --program-suffix=-1.3
		% make test install
	  installs the interpreter as fth-1.3, the library as libfth-1.3.so,
	  creates a library path /usr/local/lib/fth-1.3 for local dynamic libs
	  and installs the header files in /usr/local/include/fth-1.3:
	  /usr/local/bin/fth-1.3
	  /usr/local/lib/libfth-1.3.so
	  /usr/local/lib/fth-1.3/
	  /usr/local/include/fth-1.3/
     --with-tecla-prefix[=DIR]
	  If the tecla(7) command-line editing library is installed in other
	  places than $prefix/{include,lib} or /usr/{include,lib}, take this
	  configure option.  configure will add -IDIR/include to $(CFLAGS) and
	  -LDIR/lib to $(LDFLAGS).
     --without-tecla
	  Don't use the tecla(7) command-line editing library.

     Makefile knows the following targets:

     all
     clean
     distclean
     fth-shared
     fth-static
     install
     install-shared
     install-static
     install-strip
     maintainer-clean
     test
     uninstall

INSTALL FTH
     The usual way to configure and install Fth is:
     % ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall"
     % make
     % make test # optional
     % make install
     Or with options mentioned above and a single make command line:
     % ./configure --with-tecla-prefix=/my/tecla/prefix CFLAGS="-g -O2"
     % make test install
     While testing (make test) two environment variables are checked:
     FTH_TEST_IO
     FTH_TEST_FILE
     If set, the IO and File test will be executed.  These two tests may bear
     problems so they are disabled by default.

AUTOCONF MACRO FTH_CHECK_LIB
     An application using the Fth package as extension language can detect
     program and library using the autoconf macro FTH_CHECK_LIB which is
     located in fth.m4.	 This macro tests if the interpreter fth can be found
     in $PATH.	If so, it tests if libfth contains complex and rational
     numbers.  Eventually it substitutes six variables for configure.ac.

     After including FTH_CHECK_LIB in configure.ac call aclocal && autoconf to
     update aclocal.m4.
     FTH  Set to full path of the interpreter or "no", e.g.
	  "/usr/local/bin/fth".
     FTH_VERSION
	  Set to version number of the Fth package or "no", e.g.  "1.3.1".
     FTH_CFLAGS
	  Set to include path or "no", e.g. "-I/usr/local/include/fth".
     FTH_LIBS
	  Set to library path or "no", e.g. "-L/usr/local/lib -lfth".
     FTH_HAVE_COMPLEX
	  Set to "yes" or "no".
     FTH_HAVE_RATIO
	  Set to "yes" or "no".

   Short configure.ac Example
     AC_ARG_WITH([forth],
		 [AS_HELP_STRING([--with-forth],
				 [use Forth as the extension language])],
		 [if test "$withval" = yes ; then
		     FTH_CHECK_LIB([AC_DEFINE([HAVE_FORTH])])
		 fi])

   Long configure.as Example
     AC_ARG_WITH([forth],
		 [AS_HELP_STRING([--with-forth],
				 [use Forth as the extension language])],
		 [if test "$withval" = yes ; then
		     FTH_CHECK_LIB([AC_DEFINE([HAVE_FORTH])
				    AC_DEFINE([HAVE_EXTENSION_LANGUAGE])
				    if test "$FTH_HAVE_COMPLEX" = yes ; then
				       AC_DEFINE([HAVE_COMPLEX_TRIG])
				       AC_DEFINE([HAVE_MAKE_COMPLEX])
				       AC_DEFINE([HAVE_MAKE_RECTANGULAR])
				    fi
				    if test "$FTH_HAVE_RATIO" = yes ; then
				       AC_DEFINE([HAVE_MAKE_RATIO])
				    fi
				    AC_SUBST(XEN_CFLAGS, $FTH_CFLAGS)
				    AC_SUBST(XEN_LIBS,	 $FTH_LIBS)
				    LOCAL_LANGUAGE="Forth"
				    ac_snd_have_extension_language=yes])
		 fi])
